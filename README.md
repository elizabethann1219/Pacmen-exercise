# Pacmen-exercise
Project that creates more pacmen that move around screen as button is clicked

# How to View
Click "Code" above files

Select "download Zip"

Once downloaded, extract all files

Drag the pacmen.index file to a new browser on your machine

Click on "Add Pacman" to create more pacmen, then click on "start game" to make them move about the screen.  You may add more pacmen and click on "start game" to make them move even faster.

# Further Improvements/Changes
I would like to modify this so that the character changes with each "Add Pacman" button click.
